## ü§ù Contribute to the Koch Dictionary

We're building an open-source dictionary for the Koch language (Latin script) in structured JSON format.

If you:
- Know Koch language or its usage,
- Can help format, fix, or clean data,
- Want to support indigenous language preservation,

Then you're welcome to contribute!
# üöÄ Future Plans

We‚Äôre excited about what‚Äôs coming next for this project! Here are some things we‚Äôre working on:

- **Translator Integration**: We plan to add a feature that lets users translate Koch words into other languages, making the dictionary more useful for everyone.
  
- **Voice Translator**: In the future, we want to include a voice feature so users can hear how Koch words and phrases are pronounced correctly.

- **Multi-Language Support**: We aim to support multiple languages, helping a wider audience interact with Koch easily.

- **Script Conversion**: One of our big goals is to move from the Latin script to our own Koch script, keeping the language‚Äôs original identity alive.
